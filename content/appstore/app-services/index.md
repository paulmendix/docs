## 1 Introduction

An app service is a domain-focused and packaged business capability delivered in the form of an API or an API and associated UI. App services are flexible building blocks that include out-of-the-box integration into the Mendix development experience, enabling users to imagie new apps, extend the capability of existing apps, and significantly increase time-to-value.

When you download an app service, it will go into the **Project** > **App Store modules** folder.
