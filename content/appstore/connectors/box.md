## 1 Introduction

The [Box](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/40977/) connector provides an easy to way to use [Box](https://www.box.com) inside your Mendix application.

## 2 Installation

1. Download this connector as well as the [Community Commons Function Library](../modules/community-commons-function-library) and [Deep Link](../modules/deep-link) modules into your app project.
2. In order to use this connector, you must have an account on the Box developer site of box, so go to [BoxDEV](https://developer.box.com/) and click **Log in** > **Sign up** in the upper-right corner of the page.
3. Fill in the form with your credentials and submit.
4. Validate your account via an email, which will then give you access to the dashboard of your Box account.
5. To allow the connector access to your account, you must enable the two-factor authentication via the **Security** tab.
6. Create a new Box application that  your Mendix application will interact with by clicking **Get Started**.
7. In the new Box app, you need to set the **redirect_URL** to the domain address of your Mendix application as `https://{mendix_application_address}/link/grantaccess`. This is so Box is able to return to your application once it is authenticated.

8.  Generate an RSA keypair. The following commands may change depending on your OS:

	```
	openssl genrsa -out boxmendixappdes.key 2048
	openssl rsa -in boxmendixappdes.key -pubout > boxmendixappdes.pub
	```

	For more information on generating an RSA keypair, see [JWT Auth](https://docs.box.com/docs/app-auth#section-1-generating-an-rsa-keypair).

9. Click **Add Public key** and then copy the contents of *boxmendixappdes.pub*.
10. Run your app project to access the Box connector.
11. To connect your Box app to the connector, click **Box Applications** in the navigation bar on the left side of the connector: 

	![](attachments/box/navigation.jpg)

12. Click **New** and fill out the information according to your newly built Box app:

	![](attachments/box/new-details.jpg)

13. You need to make an account to associate the final token to, so click **Box Accounts** on the navigation layout and click **New** to make a new account.
14. After configuring the connector, you need to receive an authentication token to be able to have access to your Box account. To do that, navigate to the home page of your Mendix connector, select your Box application on the bottom of the page, and click **Log in to Box**:

	![](attachments/box/log-in-to-box.jpg)

15. Accept the request from Box asking you to give permission to the connector to access all the files and folders of your account.
16. After access is given, you will be navigated back to the connector, where you will find information regarding your token. Add your account to the **Box account** field and click **Save**:

	![](attachments/box/box-account.jpg)

17. In the **BoxConnector** module in your app project, use the **BoxApplication_Overview** page as an admin user to configure the Box connector for your application.
18. Use the **BoxAccounts_Overview** page to associate Box accounts to Mendix accounts via the  token provided by the corresponding type of Box account (user or service).
19. Make sure the **BoxApplication** entity is set with the same **redirect_URL** as you set above for your Box app.
20. Configure the Deep Link module as follows:

Congrats! You are now able to use the different [features](#features) in the connector to make your own personal app and control your Box account.
