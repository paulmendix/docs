The [Web Actions](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/114337/) module contains the following actions:

| Category | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Focus next | Moves the keyboard focus to the next element that can be focused. |
| Focus previous | Moves the keyboard focus to the previous element that can be focused. |
| Scroll to | Scrolls the window to make a targeted element visible. For this action, you need to provide a target selector. This target could be an element containing a class (for example, `.mx-class-name`, `.my-class-name`), an HTML element (for example, `td`, `div`, `a`), or an element ID (for example, `#my-element-id`).  |
| Set focus | Sets the focus to the element found with the selector. The element should be able to hold focus like a link, button, or input. For this action, you need to provide a target selector. This target could be an element containing a class (for example, `.mx-class-name`, `.my-class-name`), an HTML element (for example, `td`, `div`, `a`), or an element ID (for example, `#my-element-id`). |
