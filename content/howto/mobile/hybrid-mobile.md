## 1 Introduction

A Mendix hybrid app is a web application which runs inside a container that can be installed as a native app on your device. Hybrid apps can be deployed using the Mendix Platform, their containers enable native capabilities like camera and GPS app functions, and they can be published to the Apple App Store and Google Play.

Building hybrid apps in the cloud uses the PhoneGap Build service from Adobe. Unfortunately, Adobe no longer maintains this service. PhoneGap does not allow you to create  iOS 13 builds, but the Apple App Store requires builds be iOS 13 or higher. As a result, as of April 30th 2020, hybrid iOS apps built using the PhoneGap Build service are not being accepted on Apple's App Store.
