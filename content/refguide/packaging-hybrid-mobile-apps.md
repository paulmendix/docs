A Mendix hybrid application is a hybrid of a web and native app. If you want to publish your hybrid app on the Apple App Store or Google Play, you have to wrap your app in a native shell. We use local builds to accomplish this. For instructions on how to make and deploy local builds, see the [Publish for Mobile App Stores](/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp#publish) section in the *Mobile App Guide*.
